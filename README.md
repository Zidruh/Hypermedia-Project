### User Profile
The target users of my website are company recruiters who are looking for engineering students to do internships in their company.   

### Project Analysis, Information Architecture
I have organized the information of my website in two main sections. The first section, which is located on the left of the screen and is smaller than the right section, is where I have put secondary information, but it is still relevant. What I mean is that a recruiter does not need to look at that information to decide if I fit the job or not. In that part, I have put a small placeholder where I can put a photo of myself, followed by my name and contact information such as phone number, email, and the location where I live. After that, there are some skills that I have, languages that I know, and programming languages that I know, because I am searching for jobs related to computer engineering.

The right section of the website is where I have put the main information, like my profile, which contains who I am, my work experience, where I have worked, my role there, and the jobs that I had to do there, and some skills acquired there. My education includes what I have studied, when and where, and some extra information which I think is important, like additional titles or if I own a vehicle.
